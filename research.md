Nanoplasmonics is recognized to be one of the potentially transformative methods for photo-driven heterogeneous catalysis. Localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) can greatly influence chemical processes occurring on a metal catalystsâ€™ surface via energetic charge-carrier generation, local field enhancement, local heating, or combinations thereof. 

Recently, we show that the N2 dissociation barrier can be effectively reduced via accessing electronically excited-states, which we predicted via the embedded n-electron valence second order perturbation theory.
