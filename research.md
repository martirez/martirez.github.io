Summary. We address the kinetics of surface chemical reactions while considering electronically excited states. These simulations furnish physical understanding and put forth reinterpretation of the effect of local surface plasmon resonances on heterogeneous catalysis. We conclude that plasmon resonances may lead to oscillating-dipole-induced local surface excitations making low-barrier, excited-state chemical reaction pathways available on the surface of plasmonic metals. This is in contrast to the energetic carrier injection mechanism usually invoked to explain these phenomena.
Metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) with free-electron-like valence electrons, e.g., group I and II metals, coinage metals, and Al, have enhanced ability to scatter and absorb light of wavelengths ranging from IR to UV. This size- and shape-controlled optical response of these MNPs is referred to as a local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). LSPRs result in amplified surface and inter-particle electric fields, which then enhance light absorption of the molecules or other materials coupled to the MNPs, and/or generate hot carriers within the MNPs themselves. Plasmon-assisted catalysis on metal nanoparticles is an emerging technology that is potentially transformative for the field of heterogeneous catalysis because of the nanostructure’s ability to effectively lower reaction barriers using light. The exact mechanisms of action of the surface plasmon resonance that produces enhanced surface chemical reactivity on plasmonic catalysts are still in the early stages of investigation. We have shown and pioneered theoretical work that explores the possible role of resonance energy transfer and multiple electronic transitions on metallic surfaces in making possible otherwise high-barrier and difficult chemistries. These bodies of work contribute to understanding excited-state chemistry on surfaces of plasmonic metal nanoparticles using accurate quantum mechanical simulations. We use powerfully predictive embedded correlated wavefunction methods, within the density functional embedding theory to carry out these studies.   Our studies on surface-doped plasmon-active metals with catalytically active elements also has shown that surface dopants not only may lower reaction energy barriers, but also may act as energy funnels by introducing dense frontier surface electronic states, effectively channeling collected energy directly onto the chemical reaction.

Summary. We identify the key species and pathways in the oxygen evolution catalysis on doped nickel-based oxyhydroxides. We were able to codify doping strategies to improve the aqueous electrocatalytic oxygen evolving activity on this material, which we based on two central mechanistic features of its efficient water oxidation. We thus were able to demonstrate a mechanism-oriented design principle in the development of oxygen evolution catalysts.
The electrochemical conversion of water into hydrogen and oxygen appears to be a viable path for on-site storage of the energy harnessed from intermittent renewable energy resources, which requires a fast, high-capacity, and cheap method of converting electrical energy into fuel. Optimization of the catalyst for the complex four-electron anodic oxygen evolution reaction is among the most pressing issues in the development of this technology. Fe-doped nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) has risen to the top as a cheap material with activities rivaling that of precious-metal-based catalysts. The exceptional performance of Fe-doped NiOOH has inspired studies to identify the central chemical and mechanistic features that govern the catalytic activity of this material. We evaluate the catalytic prowess of a heretofore unexplored molecular-like four-fold-lattice-oxygen-coordinated metal active sites, while using a more accurate density functional theory approximation. These distinguish our work from the current literature, and challenge widely implemented models. We codify the chemical origins of the site’s efficiency, while also unifying prior experimental work that provided glimpses into the nature of this active site. We find dramatic differences between the O2 evolving performance of the Ni- and Fe-centered active sites, and unprecedented, near-quantitative predicted lower bounds for the electrochemical overpotentials. We show that the O2 evolving activity of the Fe-doped β-NiOOH is a combination of the ability of surface Fe(III) to be stably oxidized as Fe(IV) with a terminal oxo,  and the “dischargeable” nature of the Ni(III) to Ni(II). We proposed and later investigated two doping strategies based on the above-mentioned two crucial mechanistic features. In our most recent papers, we show that (1) a number of transition-metal dopants can be chemically modified when placed in a Ni(III) oxide environment, that many can be rendered ineffective as primary dopant. Fe(III) has near ideal redox synergism with Ni(III), unlike others. (2) Stronger oxidants compared to Ni(III), i.e., those that are found to the right of the periodic table, may promote O-O bond formation as secondary dopants. Our work highlights the utility of analyzing the redox behavior of transition metals in their molecular analogs in identifying important chemical features for efficient heterogeneous catalysts.
