## Dr. J. Mark P. Martirez - Theoretical and Computational Chemistry

email: MARTIREZ (at) princeton.edu

I'm currently a postdoctoral research associate at the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering 
at Princeton University, working with Dean Emily A. Carter [Carter-Princeton](https://carter.princeton.edu/). 

I use state-of-the-art computational tools in fields where atomic-scale information delivers unparalleled chemical design principles. The main thrust of my work is using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) and embedded correlated wavefunction (emb-CW) methods to guide experimentalists in finding alternative and unconventional reaction pathways for industrially relevant reactions. These entail computational investigations on manipulation of reactions via new or surface-modified heterogeneous catalysts and introduction of molecular co-catalysts. The foundation of my work lay on the identification of key species and pathways in catalysis from first-principles quantum mechanics.
